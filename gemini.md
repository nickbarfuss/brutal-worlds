## Developer's Note
When implementing UI changes, always prioritize consistency with the existing design language (fonts, spacing, colors, etc.). If a new component or a significant style modification is required, propose the change to the user for approval before implementation. For minor adjustments, clearly explain the rationale behind the change. This ensures design integrity while still allowing for proactive problem-solving.
